# PRDM14 Gene Expression Analysis Project

## Overview

This project conducts differential gene expression analyses on a PRDM14-knockdown gene expression dataset to address three main questions:

1. **Role of PRDM14:** Does PRDM14 play a significant role in regulating hESC self-renewal?
2. **Additional Target Genes:** Are there additional target genes of PRDM14 that may contribute to the regulation of hESC self-renewal?
3. **Transcriptional Network:** How are these identified target genes related to the core transcriptional network of hESC self-renewal and pluripotency?

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study (DataSet_01_045.txt) was downloaded from the KnockTF2.0 database (https://bio.liclab.net/KnockTFv2/download.php) under the GEO Series accession number GSE22795.
